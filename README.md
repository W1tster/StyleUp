**StyleUp** is a smart outfit recommendation web app that helps users decide what to wear. It lets users upload or scan pictures of their clothes using **Teachable Machine** for clothing recognition and color detection. Based on the scanned wardrobe, StyleUp suggests outfit combinations that match in style and color. The platform combines an intuitive website interface, AI-powered image analysis, and a personalized recommendation system to make dressing up easier and more stylish every day.

Also there is no API key in the api file. Just add your own :)
